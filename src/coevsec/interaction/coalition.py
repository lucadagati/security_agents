"""Coalition detection (proposal section 16).

A coalition is a set of two or more same-role agents that communicate
reciprocally above a threshold within an episode. Coalitions are detected
post-hoc from communication counts - never declared - so the analysis can ask
*under which conditions* cooperation emerges.
